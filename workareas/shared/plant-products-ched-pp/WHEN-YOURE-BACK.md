## [Phase A, decision] Sibling set planned as boot-time set switch, not co-residency
Recon found every L1 injection seam (manifest, fulfilment-registry, journey-flow, dispatch, records,
session, commodity-reference) is a module-level singleton — one obligation set per Node process — and
`shared/paths.js` claims a global URL namespace both sets would collide on. Decision: plan m0 around a
boot-time set switch (env-selected served set, precedent `LIVE_ANIMALS_MODE` in `services/mode.js`), so
plant-products runs as *the* set in its own process; true co-residency is recorded as an open question,
not planned tonight. The known L2 leaks (obligation NAMES hardcoded in `bridge/obligation-source.js`,
the live-animals-shaped records mapper, `router.js` registering only `[liveAnimals]`, dep-cruiser's
`routes-is-the-gateway` whitelist, and app-root convention tests hardcoding live-animals paths) become
explicit platform increments in the backlog rather than surprises mid-build.

## [Phase A, decision] m5 todo increments carried as thin stubs, not re-planned
The source CHED-PP backlog is 37 todo + 5 deferred, not "5 unblocked" as the orchestrator prompt said —
the m0–m4 own-org happy path is 31 increments and each gets a full planner agent. The six m5 todos
(CSV branch, CUC billing, consignor-search, draft lifecycle, Article 72, auth stub) are carried into the
new backlog as thin `todo` stubs with their rulings but no detailed plan, alongside the 5 `deferred`
stubs (DoA layer, consignment-for, consignment-organisation, document-upload bytes+AV, cloning).
Rationale: the prompt scopes detailed planning to m0–m4; planning m5 tonight would burn agents on work
behind unbuilt dependencies.

## [Phase A] Recon complete — 4 maps under recon/
Four parallel readers mapped: the frontend platform (13-step boot sequence, exact `configure*`
signatures, boot-time purity/coverage assertions that fail a mis-wired set at server start), the six
recipes distilled into a planner-sufficient cheat-sheet (`recon/recipe-cheatsheet.md`), the backend
animals notification aggregate (field tree, 6 Mongo collections, REST surface, reference-number
scheme), and the CHED-PP requirements digest (8 rulings, 39 page specs all present, 354 fields,
12-spoke hub). Notable for planning: Nunjucks is already multi-set ready; dep-cruiser set-isolation
rules generalise to a second set with no config change; the L1 contract table and set-scoped
`test:plant-products` npm script are manual artefacts every increment/scaffold must add to explicitly.

## [setup, pre-run] Branches merged + created, foundation pushed
The evening session merged `spike/EUDPA-288-model-retrofit` into `spike/trace-to-requirements`
in the workspace repo (clean, disjoint paths — the merge only added the model-retrofit platform on
top of the trace-requirements docs) so the branch now carries the `frontend-change` skill and the
EUDPA-288 obligation-model + promotion corpus. New `spike/trace-to-requirements` branches were cut off
`spike/EUDPA-288-model-retrofit` in both the frontend and backend repos and pushed. Nothing to check
here — this is the starting state; the orchestrator's own decisions follow above this line.
